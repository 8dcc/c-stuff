# Haskell stuff
**Stuff I made while learning haskell.**

Just like in [`c-stuff`](https://github.com/r4v10l1/c-stuff) or [`asm-stuff`](https://github.com/r4v10l1/asm-stuff) you will be able to see my progression. And that might include bad practises at first.

* [cheat.sh](https://cheat.sh/haskell/:learn) - 1337 Cheatsheet (actually useful).
