# Lisp stuff
**Stuff I made while learning common lisp**

### Description
Simple common lisp files I used for learning.

Just like in [`c-stuff`](https://github.com/8dcc/c-stuff) and
[`asm-stuff`](https://github.com/8dcc/asm-stuff) you will be able to see my
progression. And that might include bad practices at first.
