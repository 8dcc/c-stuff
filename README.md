# Lisp stuff
**Stuff I made while learning common lisp**

### Description
Simple common lisp files I used for learning.

Just like in [`c-stuff`](https://github.com/8dcc/c-stuff) and
[`asm-stuff`](https://github.com/8dcc/asm-stuff) you will be able to see my
progression. And that might include bad practices at first.

This project uses `org-mode` and `org-babel-tangle` to write the code. The code
is written in org code blocks and tangled into a final source file. The org
files contain descriptions explaining my progression, which in my opinion looks
way better than giant comments in the code.
