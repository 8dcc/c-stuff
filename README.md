# C stuff
**Stuff I made while learning the C programming language.**

## Description
Some C sources that I have written while learning C throughout these years.

> **Note**  
> The quality of this code depends on **when** it was added, so make sure you
> check the file/commit dates. I have chosen to keep the old versions to be able
> to see my progression.

## Folders
Most of the folders have a README inside them with more details.

### Book
Exercises from K&R. See ['The C Programming Language'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language).

### Codewars
Submodule for the [codewars-c](https://github.com/8dcc/codewars-c) repo.

### Advent of code 2022
Programs I made for the [advent of code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022),
until I got tired of it.

### Misc
Small C files I made for testing features or for reversing the compiled binary.
