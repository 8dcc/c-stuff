# Haskell cheatsheet
**Learning haskell. /g/ told me it was a good idea.**

Don't expect to learn anything from here, I did this for myself and it is trash.

#

### Files:
* `dababy.hs` - Basic stuff?
### Other shit
* [Haskell gist I made](https://gist.github.com/r4v10l1/3051b68d9d133e1b2bd95cabd61b850c) - Not a file.
* [cheat.sh](https://cheat.sh/haskell/:learn) - 1337 Cheatsheet (actually useful).
* [learnyouahaskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com) - Ubuntu probably.
