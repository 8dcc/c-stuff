# Book
Exercises from K&R. See ['The C Programming Language'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language).

Each folder contains some exercises, the folder names correspond to the chapter
of the exercises. Each file contains comments with the exercise they solve.

## Extra notes
- Exercises from chapter 2-09 are not here because I didn't really understand
  what they are asking. For now, I am too lazy to do them.
