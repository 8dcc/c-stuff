### Book
Exercises from 'The C Programming Language' book.

Each folder contains some exercises, the folder names correspond to the chapter of the exercises. Each file contains comments with the exercise they solve.

#### Extra notes
- Exercises from chapter 2-09 are not here because I don't really understand what they are asking.
