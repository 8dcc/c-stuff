# Lisp
**Stuff I made while learning different dialects of Lisp.**

### Description
Simple common lisp files I used for learning.

Just like in *C* and *Assembly*, you will be able to see my progression. And
that might include bad practices at first.

This project uses `org-mode` and `org-babel-tangle` to write the code. The code
is written in org code blocks and tangled into a final source file. The org
files contain descriptions explaining my progression, which in my opinion looks
way better than giant comments in the code.

Note that github doesn't render org files perfectly, so inline code blocks like
`='(1 2 3)=` would render fine in emacs, but because of the `'`, github can't
render them properly.
