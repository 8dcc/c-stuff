Scratch Lisp
------------

As mentioned in other folders, the quality of the code depends on when it was
created.

This project uses `org-mode` and `org-babel-tangle` to write the code. The code
is written in org code blocks and tangled into a final source file. The org
files contain descriptions explaining my progression, which in my opinion looks
way better than giant comments in the code.

Note that GitHub doesn't properly render org files.
