Scratch LaTeX
-------------

Small LaTeX files I made when exploring different features.

You can export `.tex` files to PDF with `pdflatex`, but you will need the
following packages (these are for arch-based distros).

    sudo pacman -S texlive-latex texlive-latexextra texlive-plaingeneric

They are also needed for exporting `.org` files to PDF from Emacs.

You can also export them to HTML files with `htlatex`, or some other tools.
