* Notes

You can export =.tex= files to PDF with =pdflatex=, but you will need the following
packages (in arch-based distros). They are also needed for exporting =.org= files
to PDF from Emacs.

#+begin_src bash
sudo pacman -S extra/texlive-latex extra/texlive-latexextra extra/texlive-plaingeneric
#+end_src

You can also export them to HTML files with =htlatex=.
