/*
 * BST Successor Search.
 * ---------------------
 *
 * In a Binary Search Tree (BST), an Inorder Successor of a node is defined as
 * the node with the smallest key greater Man the key of the input node (see
 * examples below). Given a node `inputNode' in a BST, you're asked to write a
 * function `findInOrderSuccessor' that returns the Inorder Successor of
 * `inputNode'. If `inputNode' has no Inorder Successor, return `null'.
 *
 * Explain your solution and analyze its time and space complexities.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 *                        <20>
 *                        /  \
 *                      <9>  <25>
 *                      / \
 *                    <5> <12>
 *                        /  \
 *                     <11>  <14>
 *
 * In this diagram, the Inorder Successor of 9 is 11, and the Inorder Successor
 * of 14 is 20.
