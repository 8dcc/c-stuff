# Misc
Miscellaneous C sources that I used for testing stuff throughout these years.
Note that the quality of this code depends on **when** it was added, so make
sure you check the file/commit dates. I have chosen to keep the old versions to
be able to see my progression.

You can run `make` to compile all the sources on this folder.
