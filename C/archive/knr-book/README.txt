Exercises from the K&R book. See:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language

Each folder contains some exercises, the folder names correspond to the chapter
of the exercises. Each file contains comments with the exercise they solve.

I didn't finish all of them because I started working on bigger projects.

Exercises from chapter 2-09 are not here because, back when I first read the
book, I was not familiar with bit-wise operations.
