* Chapter 4.2: Binary Search

From [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm][wikipedia]]: In computer science, binary search, is a search algorithm that
finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. Binary search
compares the target value to the middle element of the array. If they are not
equal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search
continues on the remaining half, again taking the middle element to compare to
the target value, and repeating this until the target value is found. If the
search ends with the remaining half being empty, the target is not in the array.
