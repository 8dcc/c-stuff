; int slen(char*)
; Calculates length of string
slen:
    push    ebx                 ; We wil use ebx to store the pointer to the first character of out string
    mov     ebx,eax             ; eax contains the target string, move to ebx
slen_nextchar:
    cmp     byte[eax],0         ; Check end of string
    jz      slen_finished       ; Was end of string, go to finished
    inc     eax                 ; Else, next char
    jmp     slen_nextchar
slen_finished:

    ret                         ; Return function

; void sprint(char*)
; Prints a string using the write syscall (4)
sprint:

    push    ecx
    push    ebx
    push    eax                 ; Will be on top of the stack. eax is the char* we are going to use
    
    call    slen                ; We call slen to get the length of the str (needed for edx). Returned value will be stored in eax but we have the original char* in stack
    mov     edx,eax             ; Move length to edx
    pop     eax                 ; pop the original eax (char*) from stack

    pop     ecx

; void sprintlf(char*)
; Prints a string using the sprint function + '\n'
sprintlf:

    push    eax                 ; Push eax ('\n') to stack so we can get the address
    mov     eax, esp            ; esp points to the item on top of the stack ('\n'), so we move it to eax to use as function argument for sprint
    call    sprint              ; Print newline
    pop     eax                 ; Remove newline from stack
    pop     eax                 ; Get original eax from stack

; void quit()
; Calls sys_exit (1)
